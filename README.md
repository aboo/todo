# Few Notes about the app

All the features that is mentioned in the original readme file is implemented. 
Since time was a limiting factor i used same page for both viewing the details of a todo
and editing in, switching between these two mode is done with a button.

There are several parts of the app that the descision to do something may not be clear
so ive added a few lines of comment to explain my reasons. All these comments prefixed with
"README: " to make it easy to search for every spot.

Also, i didnt find the time to write unit or widget test, i can write some for showcase if 
that is something that interests you, so just let me know.
